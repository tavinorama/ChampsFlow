# CLAUDE.md

This file is loaded into context for every Claude Code session in this project. It teaches Claude (and any agent) the rules of how this AI-native company is built and run.

**Two entry points:**
- **Single product mode** → start with `product-manager` (uses `docs/STATE.md`)
- **Full company mode** → start with `ceo-agent` (uses `docs/company/STATE.md`)

---

## Project meta
> Filled by `product-manager` (product mode) or `ceo-agent` (company mode) on init. Update only when the project itself changes.

- **Name**: OZvor (parent company) — products: **OZvor Search** (GEO / AI Search visibility platform) and **OZvor Social** (social/content execution); **OrganicPosts by Ozvor** (consultancy/DFY sub-brand)
- **One-line description**: AI Search visibility platform for SMBs and agencies — audits how a brand appears across AI search (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini, Google AI Overview), benchmarks competitors, computes the Ozvor AI Visibility Score (3 scores: Visibility / Citation Readiness / Execution), and builds a GEO content plan; OrganicPosts is the consultancy/execution arm. Never-ending subscription flywheel.
- **Sector**: general SaaS
- **Home jurisdiction**: Brazil — LGPD applies (entity registered, CNPJ on file with founder; razão social + registered address still pending for legal pages/ROPA)
- **Customer jurisdictions**: EU (GDPR) + US (CCPA/CPRA, FTC). All compliance artifacts must address Brazil (LGPD) + EU + US.
- **Domains**: **ozvor.com (primary)** · legacy TrustIndex/OrganicPosts domains to be 301-redirected to ozvor.com (not yet configured — founder action in Cloudflare; verified 2026-07-06: trustindexai.com still serves the old site)
- **Repository**: https://github.com/tavinorama/ChampsFlow
- **Initialized**: 2026-05-01
- **Pivot date**: 2026-05-29 (GEO platform pivot — Discovery re-opened)
- **Rebrand history**: 2026-05-30 (→ TrustIndex AI; home jurisdiction Brazil/LGPD) · 2026-06 (→ **Ozvor**; never reintroduce "TrustIndex" in user-facing display)

## OZvor operating model (launch/operations mode — 2026-07)

The company is run by the founder + two AI agents, with GitHub as the source of truth. Full detail, risk levels, and launch phases: **[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)**.

- **Otavio (founder, `tavinorama`)** — final approver; owns all secrets and live switches.
- **Hermes (`ozvor-hermes`)** — orchestration, planning, PR reviews, operations, company coordination.
- **Claude Code** — full-stack implementation executor. It **remains allowed** to implement across application code, infra-as-code, DB migrations, billing code, email integration, deployment config, and product pages whenever the task requires it.
- **Branches and PRs are checkpoints, not blockers.** Every change ships via branch → PR → CI green → risk-gated approval (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL per AGENTS.md §2) → merge. Merge to `main` auto-deploys (Railway), so the merge gate IS the deploy gate.
- **Founder approval is required before any live/production/destructive/paid action** (production data, live Stripe, live DNS, paid API activation, destructive commands, production migrations, secrets) — regardless of who wrote the code or what a merged doc says.
- Hard limits for agents: never edit `.env` files; never print or commit secrets; never fabricate product data (audits/scores must be real or fail honestly).

## How this project is built

ChampsFlow has two layers:

### Layer 1 — Product pipeline (7 phases). **Code is Phase 5 — never start there.**

```
1. Discovery        →  discovery-researcher  +  discovery-validator    →  Gate 0→1
2. Product (PRD)    →  product-spec-writer   +  spec-reviewer          →  Gate 2→3
3. Architecture     →  system-architect      +  architecture-reviewer  →  Gate 3→4
4. UX/UI            →  ux-designer           +  ux-reviewer            →  Gate 4→5
5. Implementation   →  coder (orchestrator)  +  code-reviewer          →  Gate 5→6
6. QA               →  qa-engineer           +  qa-reviewer            →  Gate 6→7
7. Deploy           →  devops-engineer       +  devops-reviewer        →  Gate 7
```

Phase 5 expands into specialized sub-agents dispatched by the `coder` orchestrator:
```
coder (orchestrator)
 ├── database-agent      → backend-reviewer
 ├── auth-agent          → backend-reviewer
 ├── backend-coder       → backend-reviewer
 ├── integration-coder   → backend-reviewer
 └── frontend-coder      → frontend-reviewer
```

### Layer 2 — Executive hierarchy (company-wide orchestration)

```
CEO Agent → VP Engineering → product-manager → [7-phase pipeline]
         → VP Marketing   → marketing-strategist / content-writer / seo-agent
         → VP Sales       → sales-researcher
         → VP CX          → support-agent
         → VP Finance     → finance-reporter / invoice-processor
         → VP Legal       → legal-privacy-officer / ai-ethics-reviewer / security-compliance-officer
```

Each gate is reviewed by the **Compliance & Ethics Council**:
- `legal-privacy-officer` — GDPR, EU AI Act privacy, CCPA/CPRA + state laws, FTC §5, sector regimes
- `ai-ethics-reviewer` — EU AI Act risk classification, NIST AI RMF, US sectoral AI laws
- `security-compliance-officer` — STRIDE, OWASP, SOC 2 / ISO 27001 readiness

Full pipeline detail: [docs/WORKFLOW.md](docs/WORKFLOW.md).

---

## State hierarchy

- `docs/company/STATE.md` — CEO reads this (company OKRs, department status)
- `docs/departments/[dept]/STATE.md` — each VP reads their own department state
- `docs/STATE.md` — product pipeline state (VP Engineering reads this, PM updates it)

Each layer reads only its own STATE + TL;DRs from the layer below.

---

## Hard rules (any session, any agent)

1. **Read the right STATE first** — `docs/company/STATE.md` (CEO mode), `docs/departments/[dept]/STATE.md` (VP mode), or `docs/STATE.md` (PM mode).
2. **Do not skip phases.** Code (Phase 5) requires Phases 1–4 complete and gated.
3. **Do not advance past a phase** without an `APPROVED` gate verdict in `docs/compliance/gate-log.md`.
4. **Both jurisdictions are mandatory.** Every compliance artifact must address EU and US explicitly.
5. **Compliance artifacts are incremental.** DPIA, ROPA, threat model, AI risk assessment — update sections, never rewrite from scratch.
6. **TL;DRs are contracts.** Every artifact opens with ≤200-word TL;DR. Read TL;DR first; full body only on demand.
7. **Never write code, specs, copy, or compliance content as the main session.** Always dispatch the specialist agent via Task.
8. **One agent per turn.** Sequential dispatch — no parallel sub-agents in the main flow.
9. **Workers cannot self-approve.** Reviewers cannot edit. Gate verdicts cannot be overridden silently.
10. **Append-only logs** (`docs/05-impl-log.md`, `docs/compliance/gate-log.md`, all decisions logs) — never edit historical entries.
11. **Each level reads only its level.** CEO doesn't read PRDs. VP Engineering doesn't read code. PM doesn't read company OKRs (CEO summarizes them down).

## Starting a new project from this scaffolding

### Option A — Single product (recommended for MVPs)
```
You: "product-manager: start a new SaaS — [your idea]"
```
The PM populates `Project meta`, initializes `docs/STATE.md`, and dispatches `discovery-researcher` to begin Phase 1.

### Option B — Full company (multi-department)
```
You: "ceo-agent: start a new company — [your vision]"
```
The CEO asks for company name, mission, stage, top 3 quarterly objectives, and which departments are active. Then it initializes `docs/company/STATE.md` and dispatches the most urgent VP.

If you skip the orchestrator and try to write code/copy/contracts directly, every agent in this project is instructed to refuse and route you back through the pipeline.

## Token economy

- Read order: relevant STATE → relevant TL;DRs → full body only if a verdict references a specific section.
- Each agent has narrow tools; reviewers cannot edit; council agents only append to `gate-log.md`.
- Compliance docs are living — update sections, do not rewrite.
- Default model per agent is in its frontmatter (CEO: opus; VPs + workers: sonnet; some supervisors: haiku; council: sonnet).
- Hierarchy reads up to one level only — CEO does NOT read PRDs; VP Engineering does NOT read code.
